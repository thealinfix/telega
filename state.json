Не знаю, как вы, но я порой выбираю кроссовки так же тщательно, как Джеймс Бонд выбирает автомобиль. 😂 По-моему, каждый силуэт и цвет рассказывают о нас чуть больше, чем просто \"мне было удобно\". Честно говоря, иногда кажется, что уличная мода превращается в своеобразную форму искусства. Кто еще так думает или это только у меня такие заморочки?\n\n#sneakers #кроссовки #streetwear #обувь #sneakerhead",
